## What's New

#### Milktea::Text Component with Dual Mode Architecture
A comprehensive text display component has been introduced to the Milktea framework, providing developers with sophisticated text rendering capabilities for terminal interfaces. The Text component inherits from Container, enabling it to participate in the flexbox layout system while offering specialized text handling functionality.

The component supports two distinct operational modes: wrap mode for traditional line-based text display and truncation mode for space-constrained scenarios. This dual approach addresses the fundamental challenge of text display in terminal interfaces where developers need both readable text flow and precise space management.

#### Intelligent Text Wrapping and Overflow Management
The wrap mode leverages the `strings` gem to provide Unicode-aware text wrapping that respects word boundaries and handles complex character sets including emojis and multi-byte characters. When text exceeds the available height, the component intelligently truncates at line boundaries while preserving content readability.

The implementation handles edge cases in text measurement and display, including proper positioning with terminal cursor controls and accurate bounds calculation for nested layout scenarios. This ensures text components integrate seamlessly with the broader Container layout system.

#### Truncation Mode for Space-Constrained Interfaces
The new truncation mode addresses scenarios where developers need maximum content density in limited terminal space. This mode removes all newlines from content and calculates available character space using width × height multiplication, providing a different text display paradigm optimized for dashboard-style interfaces.

The truncation algorithm supports customizable trailing indicators, defaulting to "…" but allowing developers to specify custom strings like "..." or other indicators that match their application's design language. The mode automatically handles Unicode content width calculation to ensure proper display across different character sets.

#### Comprehensive Testing and Examples
The Text component ships with 42 comprehensive test cases covering both operational modes, Unicode support, positioning, truncation scenarios, and immutability patterns. The test suite validates proper behavior across different content types, boundary conditions, and integration scenarios with the Container system.

A complete demonstration example showcases practical usage patterns for both modes, including header text with newlines, long content requiring wrapping, truncated content for compact display, and Unicode/emoji support. The example serves as both documentation and validation of the component's capabilities.

#### Strings Gem Integration
The framework now includes the `strings` gem as a core dependency, bringing professional-grade text manipulation capabilities to terminal interfaces. This integration provides Unicode-aware text width calculation, intelligent word wrapping, and sophisticated truncation algorithms that handle complex character encoding scenarios correctly.

The strings gem integration eliminates the need for custom text measurement logic and ensures consistent behavior across different terminal environments and character encodings. This foundation enables future text-related components to leverage the same robust text handling capabilities.

## What's Fixed

#### Text Positioning and Bounds Integration
Resolved initial implementation issues where text positioning used hardcoded coordinates instead of respecting the Container bounds system. The fix ensures text components correctly integrate with flexbox layouts and maintain proper positioning when used within complex Container hierarchies.

The solution involved implementing proper cursor positioning that respects both absolute coordinates (x, y) and relative positioning within allocated Container space. This enables text components to work correctly in nested layout scenarios and dynamic resizing situations.

#### Unicode Width Calculation and Display
Fixed text truncation and wrapping calculations to properly handle Unicode characters, emojis, and multi-byte character sequences. The initial implementation had inconsistencies in character width calculation that could lead to visual artifacts in terminal display.

By leveraging the strings gem's Unicode-aware algorithms, the component now correctly measures and displays complex character sets while maintaining precise layout boundaries. This ensures consistent visual appearance across different content types and terminal environments.

#### Test Coverage and Mode Isolation
Addressed test failures that occurred when implementing the dual-mode architecture by ensuring existing tests explicitly specify their expected mode. The default mode change from wrap to truncation required updating tests to maintain backward compatibility verification while testing new functionality.

The solution involved careful test organization that validates both modes independently while ensuring the mode switching logic works correctly. This provides confidence in component behavior across different usage patterns and prevents regression in existing functionality.

#### Code Style Consistency
Fixed code style violations to align with the project's established patterns, specifically converting `if...else` blocks to the preferred `return ... if` style. This maintains consistency with the codebase's early return pattern and improves code readability.

The style updates ensure the Text component follows the same patterns established in other framework components, reducing cognitive overhead for developers working across different parts of the codebase.

## Design Decisions

#### Dual Mode Architecture for Text Display
**Context**: Terminal interfaces require different text handling strategies depending on use case - some scenarios need readable text flow while others prioritize space efficiency and content density.

**Decision**: Implement a mode-based architecture with `wrap: false` (truncation) as default and `wrap: true` for traditional wrapping behavior.

**Rationale**: The truncation mode addresses the common terminal interface challenge of displaying maximum information in limited space, making it the more universally applicable default. The wrap mode preserves traditional text display expectations for content-focused scenarios. This approach provides developers with explicit control over text behavior while establishing sensible defaults for most TUI applications.

#### Container Inheritance for Layout Integration
**Context**: Text components need to participate in the flexbox layout system while providing specialized text rendering capabilities.

**Decision**: Implement Text as a Container subclass rather than a standalone Model.

**Rationale**: This design enables text components to automatically receive bounds information from parent layouts and participate in flex-based sizing calculations. The inheritance approach eliminates the need for separate layout coordination logic while maintaining the specialized text handling capabilities. It also ensures consistent behavior patterns with other layout-aware components in the framework.

#### Width × Height Character Calculation
**Context**: Truncation mode requires determining how much text can fit within allocated terminal space without line wrapping considerations.

**Decision**: Use `bounds.width * bounds.height` to calculate maximum character capacity for truncation mode.

**Rationale**: This approach treats the allocated space as a continuous character buffer, maximizing content density for information-rich interfaces like dashboards or status displays. While it removes traditional text flow patterns, it provides predictable space utilization that developers can rely on for precise layout calculations. The algorithm accounts for terminal's fixed-width character grid nature.

#### Strings Gem Dependency for Text Operations
**Context**: Proper text handling in terminal interfaces requires Unicode-aware width calculation, intelligent wrapping, and sophisticated truncation algorithms.

**Decision**: Add the `strings` gem as a core framework dependency rather than implementing custom text algorithms.

**Rationale**: The strings gem provides battle-tested text manipulation capabilities that handle edge cases in Unicode display, character width calculation, and terminal-specific formatting requirements. Using an established library reduces maintenance burden and ensures consistent behavior across different terminal environments. The dependency cost is justified by the significant improvement in text handling robustness and developer experience.

#### Customizable Trailing Indicators
**Context**: Different applications have varying design requirements for truncation indicators, and some may need to match specific visual themes or character constraints.

**Decision**: Implement configurable `trailing` option with "…" as default, allowing any string as a custom indicator.

**Rationale**: The ellipsis character provides universal recognition as a truncation indicator while remaining compact. Allowing customization enables developers to match their application's design language or work within character set constraints of specific terminal environments. The flexibility supports both minimal indicators like "..." and more descriptive ones like "[more]" for accessibility-focused applications.

#### Default Mode Selection Strategy
**Context**: The dual-mode system requires choosing which behavior serves as the default when developers don't explicitly specify mode.

**Decision**: Set `wrap: false` (truncation mode) as the default behavior.

**Rationale**: Truncation mode addresses the more common terminal interface challenge of space-constrained display and provides more predictable space utilization. Most TUI applications prioritize information density over traditional text flow, making truncation the more universally applicable choice. Developers building content-focused applications can easily opt into wrap mode, while the majority of dashboard and status-style interfaces benefit from the space-efficient default.

## Impact

The Text component introduction significantly expands Milktea's capabilities for building sophisticated terminal interfaces. Developers can now create information-dense applications with professional text rendering while maintaining the framework's layout system integration and hot reloading capabilities.

The dual-mode architecture addresses different categories of TUI applications - truncation mode enables dashboard-style interfaces with maximum information density, while wrap mode supports document-style applications with traditional text flow. This flexibility makes Milktea suitable for a broader range of terminal interface requirements.

The Unicode support and proper character width calculation ensure international applications work correctly across different character sets and terminal environments. This global compatibility is essential for modern application development and expands the framework's potential user base.

The strings gem integration establishes a foundation for future text-related components and functionality. Having robust text manipulation capabilities at the framework level enables more sophisticated features like text input components, formatted output, and advanced layout algorithms.

Development workflow improvements include comprehensive testing patterns that validate both mode behaviors and demonstrate best practices for component testing in TUI frameworks. The example implementations provide clear guidance for developers integrating text display into their applications.

The component's Container inheritance demonstrates the framework's architectural flexibility and establishes patterns for future specialized components that need layout system integration. This approach maintains consistency while enabling powerful specialized functionality.
