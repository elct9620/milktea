## What's New

#### Message::Tick for Timing-Based UI Updates
Introduced a new message type `Message::Tick` that provides timestamp information for time-dependent UI components. This enables developers to build animations, clocks, loading indicators, and other dynamic interfaces that update based on elapsed time. The Tick message includes a timestamp parameter (defaulting to `Time.now`) and integrates seamlessly into the Elm Architecture message flow.

The implementation automatically generates tick messages in the main event loop at 60 FPS, providing consistent timing information to all components. Unlike `Message::None`, tick messages trigger rendering to ensure time-based components update their display properly. This design enables smooth animations and responsive time-dependent interfaces while maintaining the framework's predictable message handling.

#### Enhanced Testing Convention Framework
Established comprehensive testing guidelines that eliminate anti-patterns and enforce consistent test structure across the codebase. The new conventions prioritize testing public behavior over implementation details, making tests more maintainable and robust against refactoring.

Key improvements include mandatory use of one-liner `it { ... }` syntax, proper `describe` blocks that reference actual methods, and `context` blocks that always start with "when" for conditional scenarios. These patterns create more readable and maintainable test suites while reducing cognitive overhead for developers working across different components.

#### Milktea::Text Component with Dual Mode Architecture
A comprehensive text display component has been introduced to the Milktea framework, providing developers with sophisticated text rendering capabilities for terminal interfaces. The Text component inherits from Container, enabling it to participate in the flexbox layout system while offering specialized text handling functionality.

The component supports two distinct operational modes: wrap mode for traditional line-based text display and truncation mode for space-constrained scenarios. This dual approach addresses the fundamental challenge of text display in terminal interfaces where developers need both readable text flow and precise space management.

#### Intelligent Text Wrapping and Overflow Management
The wrap mode leverages the `strings` gem to provide Unicode-aware text wrapping that respects word boundaries and handles complex character sets including emojis and multi-byte characters. When text exceeds the available height, the component intelligently truncates at line boundaries while preserving content readability.

The implementation handles edge cases in text measurement and display, including proper positioning with terminal cursor controls and accurate bounds calculation for nested layout scenarios. This ensures text components integrate seamlessly with the broader Container layout system.

## What's Fixed

#### Testing Anti-Pattern Elimination
Systematically removed testing anti-patterns across all spec files, transforming 18+ multi-line tests into the preferred context + one-liner format. Fixed inappropriate use of `send(:private_method)` and `instance_variable_get(:@var)` that tested implementation details rather than public behavior.

The refactoring maintained 100% test coverage while improving readability and maintainability. Tests now focus on observable outcomes through public APIs, making them more resilient to internal refactoring and clearer about component expectations. This establishes a sustainable pattern for future test development.

#### Message::Tick Rendering Behavior
Corrected the initial design where Tick messages were excluded from triggering renders. The fix ensures that time-dependent components can update their display when tick events occur, enabling proper animation and dynamic UI behavior. This change resolved the fundamental issue that would have prevented time-based interfaces from working correctly.

The solution involved updating the runtime message handling to treat Tick messages like other render-triggering events while maintaining the optimization that `Message::None` doesn't cause unnecessary redraws. This balanced approach provides the timing functionality developers need while preserving performance for static content.

#### Text Positioning and Bounds Integration
Resolved initial implementation issues where text positioning used hardcoded coordinates instead of respecting the Container bounds system. The fix ensures text components correctly integrate with flexbox layouts and maintain proper positioning when used within complex Container hierarchies.

The solution involved implementing proper cursor positioning that respects both absolute coordinates (x, y) and relative positioning within allocated Container space. This enables text components to work correctly in nested layout scenarios and dynamic resizing situations.

#### Terminal Screen Clearing Behavior
Fixed the renderer's screen clearing behavior to use `clear_screen_down` instead of `clear_screen`, preventing the terminal from clearing the entire scrollback history. This change improves user experience by preserving terminal history while still properly clearing the application's display area.

The fix addresses the common terminal application issue where applications aggressively clear the entire screen, causing users to lose their command history and previous terminal output. The new approach only clears from the cursor position downward, maintaining the user's terminal session context while ensuring clean application rendering.

## Design Decisions

#### Testing Architecture: Public API Focus
**Context**: The codebase had accumulated testing patterns that relied on accessing private methods and instance variables, creating brittle tests coupled to implementation details.

**Decision**: Mandate testing only through public interfaces and observable behavior, with strict prohibition of `send(:private_method)` and `instance_variable_get(:@var)` patterns.

**Rationale**: Tests should verify what components do, not how they do it internally. This approach makes tests more maintainable during refactoring, clearer about component contracts, and focused on user-observable behavior. The stricter guidelines prevent future accumulation of implementation-dependent tests while establishing sustainable patterns for the growing codebase.

#### Message::Tick Rendering Strategy
**Context**: Time-based UI components need regular updates to display current state, but the framework optimizes performance by avoiding unnecessary renders.

**Decision**: Enable Tick messages to trigger rendering while maintaining the optimization that `Message::None` events don't cause redraws.

**Rationale**: Animations, clocks, and loading indicators require visual updates when time progresses, even if no user interaction occurs. Excluding Tick from rendering would break time-dependent interfaces. The selective approach preserves performance optimizations for static content while enabling dynamic time-based behavior where needed. This balances responsiveness with resource efficiency.

#### Testing Convention Enforcement
**Context**: As the codebase grows, inconsistent testing patterns create maintenance overhead and cognitive load for developers working across different components.

**Decision**: Enforce standardized test structure with one-liner syntax, method-referencing describe blocks, and "when"-prefixed context blocks.

**Rationale**: Consistent patterns reduce the mental overhead of understanding tests and make it easier to identify what functionality is being verified. The one-liner preference encourages clear, focused test cases that verify single behaviors. Standardization enables developers to quickly navigate and understand test intent across the entire framework, improving development velocity and reducing onboarding time.

#### Dual Mode Architecture for Text Display
**Context**: Terminal interfaces require different text handling strategies depending on use case - some scenarios need readable text flow while others prioritize space efficiency and content density.

**Decision**: Implement a mode-based architecture with `wrap: false` (truncation) as default and `wrap: true` for traditional wrapping behavior.

**Rationale**: The truncation mode addresses the common terminal interface challenge of displaying maximum information in limited space, making it the more universally applicable default. The wrap mode preserves traditional text display expectations for content-focused scenarios. This approach provides developers with explicit control over text behavior while establishing sensible defaults for most TUI applications.

#### Documentation Integration Strategy
**Context**: Testing conventions needed to be preserved and communicated to prevent regression to anti-pattern usage.

**Decision**: Update CLAUDE.md with comprehensive anti-pattern prevention guidelines and reorganize existing rules for clarity.

**Rationale**: Embedding conventions in the project documentation ensures they persist beyond the current development session and guide future contributors. The prominent placement of anti-pattern warnings helps developers avoid common mistakes while the reorganized structure makes the guidelines more discoverable and actionable.

## Impact

The Message::Tick implementation opens up entirely new categories of TUI applications that Milktea can support, including games, monitoring dashboards, and interactive animations. Time-based interfaces are now first-class citizens in the framework, with built-in support for smooth updates and consistent timing.

The testing convention improvements establish a sustainable foundation for the project's growth. With clear guidelines preventing anti-patterns and encouraging consistent structure, the codebase can scale without accumulating technical debt in the test suite. Future contributors have clear guidance for writing maintainable tests that focus on behavior rather than implementation.

The Text component introduction significantly expands Milktea's capabilities for building sophisticated terminal interfaces. Developers can now create information-dense applications with professional text rendering while maintaining the framework's layout system integration and hot reloading capabilities.

The combined effect of these improvements positions Milktea as a more mature and capable TUI framework. The timing system enables dynamic interfaces, the testing framework ensures long-term maintainability, and the text component provides essential UI building blocks. These foundational improvements support more ambitious application development while maintaining the framework's core strengths.
